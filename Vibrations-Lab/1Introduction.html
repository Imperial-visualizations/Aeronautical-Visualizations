            <p align="justify">The mass, spring, damper system displayed above is the typical setting that is analysed as a start of any Vibrations module, providing all the necessary components that allow us to understand the dynamic behaviour of a one degree  of freedom system. However, as you will see, the Vibration of an Aircraft Laboratory, even though complex, can be split into components that behave exactly like the system in the figure.</br>
            The following part contains the graphical representation of the response of such a system. Before you advance, however, allow yourself some time to answer the follwing questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the structure is loaded at different values of $\omega$, how do you imagine that the amplitude of displacement, velocity and acceleration would vary?</li>
                    <img src="styles/image1.jpg" alt="image1" class="center">
                    <li>How do you imagine changing the amplitude of the applied force, $R_0$ would affect the resonant frequency, phase or amplitude of the response?</li>
                    <img src="styles/image2.jpg" alt="image2" class="center">
                    <li>How do you imagine that an increase in damping would change the shape of the curves representing the amplitude and phase response?</li>
