            <p align="justify">The mass, spring, damper system displayed above is the typical setting that is analysed as a start of any Vibrations module, providing all the necessary constraints that allow us to understand the dynamic behaviour of a one degree  of freedom system. However, as you will see, the Vibration of an Aircraft Laboratory, even though complex, can be split into components that behave exactly like the system in the figure.</br>
            The next slide contains the graphical representation of the response of such a system. Before you advance, however, allow yourself some time to answer the follwing questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the structure is loaded at a different values of $\omega$, how would the aplitude of displacement, velocity and acceleration vary?</li>
                    <li>How does changing the amplitude of the applied force, $R_0$ affect the resonant frequency, phase or aplitude of the response?</li>
                    <li>How does an increase in damping change the shape of the curves representing the amplitude and phase response?</li>
                </ul>
